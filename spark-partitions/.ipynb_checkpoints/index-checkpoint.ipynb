    "When you run a PySpark query that has a filter condition on the partition column, like SELECT * FROM table WHERE date = '2021-01-01', Spark can perform a \"partition pruning\". This means that Spark will only read the data from the relevant partition (date=2021-01-01 in this case) and will completely skip over other partitions. This can significantly reduce the amount of data read and speed up the query.\n",
